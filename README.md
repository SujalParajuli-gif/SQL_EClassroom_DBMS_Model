Built entirely using **SQL**, the system includes:
- Relational table design with **primary and foreign key constraints**
- **Normalization** of data for efficiency and integrity
- Complex **JOIN queries**, **aggregate functions**, and **nested subqueries**
- Use of **views**, **set operations**, and **data manipulation commands**
